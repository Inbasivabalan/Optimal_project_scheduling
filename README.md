The project involves three datasets: project1, project2, and project3. Project1 covers a period of 12 months, project2 covers 24 months, and project3 covers 8 months. The goal of the project is to analyze the datasets using a genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters and draw insights from them.

Datasets:

Project1: This dataset covers a period of 12 months and contains data on a variety of metrics related to a particular project. The data has been cleaned and is ready for analysis.

Project2: This dataset covers a period of 24 months and contains data on various aspects of a project, including financial data and project timelines. The data has been cleaned and is ready for analysis.

Project3: This dataset covers a period of 8 months and contains data on the usage of a particular product. The data has been cleaned and is ready for analysis.

Genetic Algorithm

A genetic algorithm has been used to optimize the parameters for analyzing the datasets. The algorithm works by generating a population of potential solutions and then selecting the best solutions to produce offspring. The offspring inherit traits from their parents and the process is repeated until an optimal solution is found.

The genetic algorithm has been implemented using a software tool and the parameters have been optimized to draw insights from the datasets.
